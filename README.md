## 📌 Project Overview

**TA Hub** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the management of Teaching Assistants (TAs) at the university level. The platform centralizes TA assignments, availability scheduling, and communication between instructors and TAs — replacing fragmented email threads and spreadsheets with a unified, role-aware digital hub.

Built as the **final project for CEN5035 (Software Engineering)** at the University of Florida, TA Hub was developed following professional software engineering practices including Agile sprints, requirements gathering, system design, implementation, and testing.

> **The Problem:** Managing TAs across multiple courses involves complex scheduling, role assignments, and communication — currently handled through disconnected tools that are error-prone and time-consuming.
>
> **The Solution:** A centralized web platform where administrators, instructors, and TAs each have role-specific dashboards to manage assignments, office hours, and course responsibilities efficiently.

## 🔄 Software Engineering Process

This project was built using formal software engineering practices as part of CEN5035:

**Requirements Engineering** — User stories defined for Admin, Instructor, and TA roles with clear acceptance criteria

**System Design** — Architecture diagrams, ER diagrams, and UI wireframes created before implementation

**Agile Development** — Work divided into sprints with iterative feature delivery and peer code reviews

**Testing** — Functional testing across all user roles and edge cases; manual QA on all core flows

**Documentation** — Maintained throughout development including setup guide and demo video

---

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases competencies central to **Full-Stack Software Engineering** and **Agile Team Development** roles:

- Full-stack JavaScript development (Node.js + Express + EJS)
